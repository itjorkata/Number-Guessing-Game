# Number-Guessing-Game
Name: The Little Game

It is a little game that thinks of a number, which the user should try and guess.

Gameplay:
The game first asks for the user's name, so it can address them accordingly. Then it will think of a random number from 0 to 10 (incl.) and ask the user for inputs until the number is guessed. The Little Game responds with a clue to each incorrect input. To limit the possible entries until a correct guess, the numbers are limited to integers.

Extra functionality:
The game asks explicitly for inputs of numbers from 0 to 10. But if the user feels rebelious they can input any positive or negative integer, float or string. The code would not break, but The Little Game would not like the joke and will give a response.

Completeness of code:
This code is as finished as any other code... Meaning its being regularly modified.
